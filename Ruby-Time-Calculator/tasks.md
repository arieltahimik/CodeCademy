# Tasks
1. You are currently on master.  
Merge the edits branch into the master branch.  
This will create two merge conflicts: README.md and examples.md.  
```bash
git merge edits
```
<br>

2. Using the file navigator, open README.md and examples.md. Identify the merge conflicts.  

<br>

3. In README.md, keep the file changes from the edits branch. Delete the file changes from HEAD.  
Don’t forget to delete all of Git’s special markings that indicate a merge conflict.  
Click Save.
