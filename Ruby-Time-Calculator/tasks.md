# Tasks
1. You are currently on master.  
Merge the edits branch into the master branch.  
This will create two merge conflicts: README.md and examples.md.  
```bash
git merge edits
```
<br>

2. Using the file navigator, open README.md and examples.md. Identify the merge conflicts.  

<br>

3. In README.md, keep the file changes from the edits branch. Delete the file changes from HEAD.  
Don’t forget to delete all of Git’s special markings that indicate a merge conflict.  
Click Save.  

<br>

4. Add README.md to the staging area.

<br>

5. Follow the same order of actions as above for examples.md: keep the edits branch file changes and delete the HEAD changes.  
Click Save.  

<br>

6. Add examples.md to the staging area and make a commit. Your commit message could be “Resolve merge conflict”.
